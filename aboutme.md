My name is Gerardo Mauricio Toledo Acosta. I'm a Mathematician working on Complex Kleinian Groups and Natural Language Processing. I'm also a music composer and runner.

Now, I'm a post-doc researcher at the Computational Semantics Laboratory in the CINC-UAEM in the city of Cuernavaca. I am currently working on Discourese Relations Patterns. I also study Complex Kleinian Groups. 

### My Publications

[Some of my pre-prints](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Toledo-Acosta%2C+M) on the ArXiV. 

### My Music

This is [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNFBAvn4Z28pvqXyTwEBz9Q), I usually post my music over there.

I have run 2 marathons (my PB is 3 hours and 42 minutes) and 4 half marathons (my PB is 1 hour and 39 minutes). These are my favorite distances, although I have also run 10K (PB - 45 minutes) and 5K (PB - 22:32).
